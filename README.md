Hello! My name is Randell L. Zapanta. I am a second-year student at T.I.P, currently taking Industrial Engineering. I have a fair share of experience with the programming language C++, but not as much with Python. Coding can be quite challenging for me, so I have to go the extra mile to keep up. I may not be the brightest student when it comes to coding, but I am definitely willing to learn. Please be nice to me!
